      "bio": "Henare was goaded into his first ever open source contribution in a chance encounter at a free software conference 7 years ago. Hacking on civic tech was the creative outlet for his passion for politics and open source that he'd been looking for. He's been volunteering at the OpenAustralia Foundation ever since and is now one of the first full-time staff where he does everything from software development to decoding government jargon into plain language. He has spoken at, and helped organise, civic tech and transparency conferences around the world and is a major contributor to several international open source civic tech projects. He has recently been teaching intensive scraping workshops. In these he has helped people with almost no programming knowledge write their very own scraper in just 4 hours. When not hacking democracy he is an enthusiastic amateur cook and is considered by some to be a master barbequist.",
