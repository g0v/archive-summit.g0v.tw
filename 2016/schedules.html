In spite of the diversity of platforms and applications, many initiatives have focussed too much on the tech side of ‘civic tech’, leaving the civic part aside, or relegated to a second order of priority. As a result, many of our initiatives shine when it comes to technology implementations, but often lack social and political impact when it comes to addressing corruption or improving public services. Apparently, our technology surplus is positively correlated with our limited understanding of the politics of government bureaucracies, political parties, and the incentives of reelection.  In this presentation, I will aim to make the case for leveraging the civic side of civic tech. Informed by the 8 year experience of Ciudadano Inteligente in Chile and Latin America, I will explain how the organization has changed it’s strategy and the nature of our initiatives, to include lobby, social media campaigning and judicial lawsuits, in combination with ongoing open source and open data efforts. I will highlight how these changes have allowed Ciudadano Inteligente to significantly improve it’s social and political impact, while also triggering new challenges when it comes to funding and sustainability.","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Felipe Heusser"}]},{"@type":"Event","location":{"@type":"Place","@id":"#R1","name":"第1會議室 1st Conference Room","address":"台北市南港區研究院路二段128號3F / 3F No.128, Sec. 2, Academia Rd., Nangang Dist., Taipei City 115, Taiwan","url":"http://hssb.committee.sinica.edu.tw/room-2.html"},"startDate":"2016-05-15T10:00:00.000+08:00","endDate":"2016-05-15T10:30:00.000+08:00","offers":[{"@id":"#offer-earlybird"},{"@id":"#offer-regular"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-invite"},{"@id":"#offer-vip"},{"@id":"#offer-vip-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-reserved"}],"name":"How to extend Civic Tech to civic organizations (NPO, NGO, and the media) in KOREA?","description":"CodeNamu, initiated by Creative Commons Korea as an open data project since 2011, has built communities, hosted yearly hackathons, and made lots of data storytelling projects. However we failed to put our message deeply, or some of results were quite meaningful but we fail to spread out our messages or our acts to outside community. How can we extend civic tech to civic organizations outside community?  In South Korea. most of civic organizations(NPO, NGO, and the media) are interested in data and data journalism, but they don’t have capacity to treat the data and data journalism. Event they don’t have any developers to maintain their own website. Because of that, after they constructed huge and valuable data to make stories for years, the data has been hidden somewhere on their PCs in not-machine-readable formats.  From this year, we’re developing a Data Specialists Working Group composed of civic hackers; technitians, designers, and data experts. This group will be in partnerships with NPO, NGO, and the media for data journalism projects. CodeNamu civic technitians and our partners composed of journalists and activits will make synergy to make those data open and to make various data journalism projects between CodeNamu’s civic tech and partners’ insight or messages. We hope that we’re going to introduce and discuss about the way to extend civic tech to outside civic tech community.","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Hoony Jang"}]},{"@type":"Event","location":{"@type":"Place","@id":"#R0","name":"國際會議廳 International Conference Hall","address":"台北市南港區研究院路二段128號4F / 4F No.128, Sec. 2, Academia Rd., Nangang Dist., Taipei City 115, Taiwan","url":"http://hssb.committee.sinica.edu.tw/room-1.html"},"startDate":"2016-05-15T10:00:00.000+08:00","endDate":"2016-05-15T10:30:00.000+08:00","offers":[{"@id":"#offer-earlybird"},{"@id":"#offer-regular"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-invite"},{"@id":"#offer-vip"},{"@id":"#offer-vip-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-reserved"}],"name":"Democracy and Civic Engagement as an Open Media","description":"At Voxe.org we seek to build online tools that revolutionize civic engagement by bringing to the public easy access, neutral and crowdsourced information.

They are less political then governments, more focused on problem solving. They are never pefect but when you open up 10 cities with half a million people living in them - you suddenly make a national change. Bottom up and thumbs up. We created a formula which attracts cities to open up their data, engage citizens and make sure that data is used. And most importantly by introducing open data policies in Poland we make the change systemic.  Openness it is not only about publishing information. It’s essential part of building engagement in modern society. But we – citizens – need and often demand something more. We are ready to take responsibility for the place we live and work. We do care about the quality of the life we live in our cities. We need to be treated as partner by our government.  At first Personal Democracy Forum in Poland in 2013, Ellen Miller from Sunlight Fundation said that \"government is as strong as citizens informed\". Government can publish information, make it available, machine readable and up-to-date, but it will not encourage much more people to check them.  Can we do anything more to engage people in city life, to show them advantages of being active? How new technologies are moving us closer to participation? Did new applications can connect (or disconnect) citizens? Is it possible to empower citizens and allow them to manage our cities (not only from time to time, but daily)? How – by using technology – citizen can gather around idea, support it and make it happen?  And I can show examples of such process in Poland (Central Eastern Europe).","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Katarzyna Mikołajczyk"}]},{"@type":"Event","location":{"@id":"#R1"},"startDate":"2016-05-15T11:30:00.000+08:00","endDate":"2016-05-15T12:00:00.000+08:00","offers":[{"@id":"#offer-earlybird"},{"@id":"#offer-regular"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-invite"},{"@id":"#offer-vip"},{"@id":"#offer-vip-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-reserved"}],"name":"From .org to .g0v －Internet participant and digital challenge of NGO in Taiwan","description":"2000 年 dotcom 泡沫帶來最正向的影響之一就是連網的成本大幅降低，也創造了NGO透過網路發展的機遇。台灣環境資訊協會源起於 2000-4-17 創刊的環境資訊電子報，著眼於網路低成本高效率的資訊傳播，成為了 .org.tw 的成員之一。本次將藉由下列幾個主題切入，當 NGO 從 nobody 變成了 somebody 時， 組織運作和運用網路技術的問題和眉角進行回顧及反思。   * 從 Web 1.0 到物聯網－時空背景的變化  * 「網路型NGO」在資訊公開，公民參與和網路技術發展的可能角色  * 反思與挑戰：駭客，技術長還是資訊長","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Y.H.

By telling the audience the story of our successes and mistakes along the way, I will offer the audience with the state of mind that has allowed Transparency International (TI) Lithuania to grow into a top-notch go-to organization known to every second business person and every fifth member of the public - in our continuous advocacy efforts to encourage change and make sure that an ever-increasing number of Lithuanians become and act as owners of their state.  To illustrate this state of mind, I would like to show how TI Lithuania has successfully merged the availability of data, the talents of its coding teams and public advocacy savvy: 1. to ensure greater transparency in Lithuanian politics with the help of the parliamentary oversight website [www.manoseimas.lt] ;  2. to allow for greater public awareness of media ownership and accountability by collecting and constantly updating all available data on media ownership at www.stirna.info;  3. to encourage people to find and contact their representatives with the help of www.parasykjiems.lt [www.parasykjiems] ;  4. to help Lithuanian courts open up to the public and be the first ones in the country to publish performance data of courts and judges with www.atvirasteismas.lt; and  5. to track interests of local politicians with www.jurgiokepure.lt [www.jurgiokepure.lt] .    In 2015, with all these tools combined TI Lithuania helped more than 100 thousand people, or almost 4 per cent of the entire Lithuania population, get engaged and individually seek greater transparency in their daily lives. With the numbers of concerned citizens and TI Lithuania partners growing every year, I hope my story will inspire others to explore innovative ways to create real-life change and prompt decision-makers and the public alike to check what technology has in store for democracy.","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Sergejus Muravjovas"}]},{"@type":"Event","location":{"@id":"#R0"},"startDate":"2016-05-15T12:00:00.000+08:00","endDate":"2016-05-15T12:30:00.000+08:00","offers":[{"@id":"#offer-earlybird"},{"@id":"#offer-regular"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-invite"},{"@id":"#offer-vip"},{"@id":"#offer-vip-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-reserved"}],"name":"Pol.is in Taiwan: Bridging the gap between public discourse, consultation, and policy","description":"Pol.is is a new tool for gathering crowd sentiment in a way that preserves and respects minority opinions.

I'm going to share a story about a much longer game, where the payoff is just starting to happen now, five years later.  This will be a story of how organizations around the world built a software stack for legislative monitoring. It starts with a vision shared in Warsaw in 2011. In 2012, work on a standard data interchange format begins, which will tie the stack together. Two organizations start authoring backend data management tools in 2013 using this format. In 2014, the first user-facing tools appear at the top of this stack. And in 2015, governments begin adopting the data standard, as more user-facing tools spread.  This journey will visit many organizations and projects around the world, from mySociety to OpenAustralia to Sunlight, and from PopIt to Councilmatic to Represent, among others. We're five years into this journey, and there's still more ground to cover for at least as many more years before the basic problems in legislative monitoring that we're solving can be taken for granted.  This talk ties into the fork-merge theme. Legislative monitoring generally involves forking the official website, which requires scraping data to reproduce the information.

That's why we built morph.io - the free and open source web scraping platform for the international civic tech community.  With morph.io code collaboration stays where it belongs - on GitHub. We support 5 of the most popular programming languages so you can write your scraper in the language you know and love. Your scraper runs in the cloud to your schedule and emails you if there are any problems. You can then download your data in CSV or even do SQL queries using the simple API.  In this talk I will introduce morph.io and show you how everything works behind the scenes. We will then explore some of the thousands of existing scrapers and I'll show you how you can access the tens of millions of rows of data they've already collected.

The Kathmandu Valley has grown especially rapidly – from a population of about 1.6 million in 2001 to a population of about 2.5 million in 2011. This unexpected and unplanned growth has proven a challenge to many aspects of city life. The systems by which residents communicate, organize themselves, and negotiate with each other and the state has altered. When the intention is to radically reform the system, large amounts of money and manpower must be gathered. At the same time, there are few initiatives as well who take the opposite approach. New belief is that limited resources and focus also be sufficient in order to begin to dent the system as much as possible on basis of collaborations and crowdsourcing even though there are no single and known solutions to the complex issues of urban governance and no guarantee that any given intervention will succeed.  GalliGalli is an initiative based in Kathmandu which gathers, packages, and disseminates information using new technologies for the civilians to make their lives easier by providing information on processes – formal and informal – for accessing government services. GalliGalli works both on-the-ground and online. GalliGalli’s core focus is to use open source approach to enable people to take part in social change by facilitating mass participation. This paper would like to explain how these processes and practices are developed and experimented by GalliGalli using technologies to promote government transparency and attract civic participation through crowdsourcing on different topics which aims to bridge citizen-state gap into daily governance.  This paper will focus on ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed in Kathmandu to support state-citizens interaction as service providers-and-receivers. For example, when people want to start a business or non-profit, they have to register at the concerned government offices. Subsequently, there are periodic obligations such as submitting annual reports, filing tax returns, and calling general meeting. ‘Nalibeli’ plays a role of consultant to equip people with all the necessary information to fulfill these obligations. Not only through online open technology, a group of young volunteers also visit the concerned offices and guide people through each of the steps if they require support. ‘Nalibeli’ also perform Service Delivery Mapping which is an on-the-ground survey, research, and mapping initiative to document the nature of day-to-day problems faced by citizens, creating a listing of service providers by locality, understand the manner in which neighbourhoods organize. Most of these information are made available through an open platform ( www.nalibeli.org [www.nalibeli.org] ) with step-by-step information on how to access a range of government services. The platform runs on information shared by thousands of individual users. The usefulness of the platform increases as the number of active users grow. The platform has information in Nepali and English. This paper aims to unpack these complex realities of running open source approach to facilitate state-citizens relationship focusing on the ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed by GalliGalli initiative.","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Rajib Timalsina"}]},{"@type":"Event","location":{"@id":"#R0"},"startDate":"2016-05-15T15:40:00.000+08:00","endDate":"2016-05-15T16:10:00.000+08:00","offers":[{"@id":"#offer-earlybird"},{"@id":"#offer-regular"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-invite"},{"@id":"#offer-vip"},{"@id":"#offer-vip-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-reserved"}],"name":"\"Bluepa\" Metrics and Case Studies for Interdisciplinarity: the Mystery of Openness and Interdisplinary in g0v","description":"g0v 社群一開始便吸引跨界專業的參與，也持續與其他團體跨界交流。秉持社群文化的開源人與 ngo / gov 的合作越來越緊密，不再只是當顧問、或分享成果，更多實際親身加入傳統組織，進行更深層協作的實例。  但對更多團體來說，如何與猶如變形蟲的開放非組織 g0v 協作，仍是一個謎；對習慣開放的開源社群人而言，與傳統團體合作也需要轉換邏輯。本 talk 由兩位 g0v 參與者設計的 「Blupa 量表：g0v 跨界量表」，由淺到深拉出各類合作型態光譜，檢視各種協作的火花、眉角、悲喜劇。  前半由 ipa 從開源社群與傳統團體文化差異談起，探討開源非組織的「沒有人」的 “release early, release often”、“fork & merge” 等開放黑客文化對傳統團體的衝擊，以及為何/如何與傳統組織協作。後半由 ETBlue 分享實際案例，使用 Blupa 量表來分析個人在憲動盟、OCF 蹲點經驗。期待拋磚給想讓手上專案加速的 NGO / GOV 成員以及希望手上專案接地氣的 g0ver / 開源人，讓開源的、開放的黑客版社會參與越來越不謎。","performers":[{"@type":"Person","name":"ipa"},{"@type":"Person","name":"ETBlue"}]},{"@type":"Event","location":{"@id":"#R2"},"startDate":"2016-05-15T15:40:00.000+08:00","endDate":"2016-05-15T16:10:00.000+08:00","offers":[{"@id":"#offer-earlybird"},{"@id":"#offer-regular"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-invite"},{"@id":"#offer-vip"},{"@id":"#offer-vip-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-reserved"}],"name":"Using OpenStreetMap to help other countries and improve foreign relations","description":"開放街圖具有自由且開源的特性，適合集群眾之力來繪製圖資缺乏地區，本次將以在中西非聖多美及普林西比的瘧疾防治計畫為例，使用開放街圖來繪製當地基本圖資，使用繪製地圖的GPS等相關設備以及與當地人會談來收集資訊，將當地十分缺乏的地理資訊數位化、現代化，並可將圖資應用在各項計畫的分析上，如瘧疾病例與孳生源的空間關係分布等，結合當地實際數據，對瘧疾以及其他疾病更有效率的防治。","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"W.S.

LocalWiki is using OSM for visualizing geographic objects, e.g., a restaurant, a plaza, or an old tree. However, the geographic objects visualized on LocalWiki aren’t interlinked to OSM. The users of LocalWiki actually draw the geographic objects but don’t take geographic objects from OSM. In addition, the geographic objects drawn on LocalWiki aren’t stored in OSM. This project undertakes the improvement of LocalWiki for working together with OSM. The improved LocalWiki will provide a function that users can directly select geographic objects form OSM. As a result, a geographic object textually described LocalWiki can be correspondingly linked to its geographic information on OSM.  In recent years, OSM often plays an important role in disaster relief. This is because OSM can provide users to map the areas influenced by disaster. In contrast, OSM also allows mappers to contribute the geographic objects associated with disasters such as shelters before a disaster happens. The mapping is a kind of disaster preparedness that is beneficial for mitigating the impact of a coming disaster. The improved LocalWiki will be used for citizens to provide disaster preparedness information and map the information in community level.","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Dongpo Deng"}]},{"@type":"Event","location":{"@id":"#Rall"},"startDate":"2016-05-15T16:45:00.000+08:00","endDate":"2016-05-15T17:00:00.000+08:00","offers":[{"@id":"#offer-earlybird"},{"@id":"#offer-regular"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-invite"},{"@id":"#offer-vip"},{"@id":"#offer-vip-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-reserved"}],"name":"Code for All – Civic Tech around the World","description":"Coding for the public good is a global movement, from the US to Japan, from Mexico, to Pakistan developers are using their skills to hold government to account and to make life easier for all of us.

Voter Advice Applications, or VAAs, leverage similar techniques, but reverse the direction of the telescope: voters get a better understanding of candidates, not the other way around (see this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_advice_application] ).  VAAs have gained popularity in Canada, Germany, Britain, the Benelux countries and Switzerland, where around 10% of the population use a VAA (see euvox2014 [http://www.euvox2014.eu/] , A review of the top Voter Advice Applications for the 2015 General Election [http://www.democraticaudit.com/?p=12419] , Voting Advice Applications in Europe: The State of the Art [http://www.academia.edu/281395/Voting_Advice_Applications_in_Europe_The_State_of_the_Art] for more examples from Europe).  A basic VAA asks a series of questions that probe a user's political preference, then uses a distance measurement algorithm to visualize her position relative to parties and candidates that are standing in election. Ping, the first service of this kind to launch in East Asia, adds on to successes elsewhere in two ways: first, Ping provides local candidate information, beyond national party positions. Second, Ping crowd-sources its questions, so that users can ask district-specific questions to each candidate.  The session will begin by reviewing the then-recent Korean General Election (held April 16) and place Ping in the broader context of the Korean Civic Hacking / Open Data community.","performers":[{"@type":"Person","name":"JK Suh"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Uk-Jin Yang"}]},{"@type":"Event","location":{"@id":"#R2"},"startDate":"2016-05-15T14:40:00.000+08:00","endDate":"2016-05-15T15:10:00.000+08:00","offers":[{"@id":"#offer-earlybird"},{"@id":"#offer-regular"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-regular-invite"},{"@id":"#offer-vip"},{"@id":"#offer-vip-donate"},{"@id":"#offer-reserved"}],"name":"Environment data transparency for cross-strait applications","description":"中國大陸近年在環境與污染資訊公開的推展上有相當大的躍進，其民間環保NGO也運用此發展的契機，設計一套NGO-政府資料公開－品牌－供應鏈的污染資料庫與施壓模式，透過促使「品牌倒逼」，強力要求供應鏈必須完成污染的整改工作，最後再由NGO主導最後的審核。  綠色公民行動聯盟計劃製作一企業污染資料庫與地圖，一方面施壓官方是出更多的環境污染資訊，同時結合Opendata之形式，將環境資料地圖化與建制企業環境表現檔案，強化地區環境知情權與公民行動介入的空間，協助建立地方的環境監督網絡。另外，由於兩岸之間生產轉移密切，也帶動不少污染行為的轉移，綠盟也將與中國大陸NGO合作，引入其收集整理的台資在中國的污染記錄，促成兩岸的資訊同步，形成協同監督污染轉移行為的網絡，更希望促成社會以企業社會責任的角度，重新思考企業污染轉移行為的影響、評價與規範。","performer":[{"@type":"Person","name":"S.H.
